# Code for Learning Object 2 - Search Algorithms

At this time the algorithms implemented are **breadth-first**, **depth-first**, **depth-limited**, **iterative deepening**,
**uniform cost**, **iterative lengthening** (might be incorrect), **greedy best-first** and **A*** search.

The problems implemented are **missionaries and cannibals** as well as **fox, goose and beans** where both support a variable number
of people/objects.
